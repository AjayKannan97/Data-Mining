# CSE511 - Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the CSE511 course. The project focuses on **efficient query processing and optimization techniques** for large-scale datasets.

## Project Details
- **Course**: CSE511 - Data Processing at Scale
- **Institution**: Arizona State University (ASU)
- **Topic**: Query optimization and efficient data retrieval
- **Technologies Used**: SQL, Apache Spark, Python, PostgreSQL

## Dataset
The project utilizes a **large-scale dataset** stored in PostgreSQL. The dataset has been indexed and optimized to improve query performance.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Query Execution**: Optimized SQL queries for better execution time.
- **Indexing & Partitioning**: Implemented indexing techniques to speed up data retrieval.
- **Distributed Processing**: Used Apache Spark for large-scale data operations.
- **Query Performance Analysis**: Benchmarked different optimization techniques.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Apache Spark (if running distributed queries)
- Python 3.x with required libraries

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AjayKannan97/CSE511---Project-.git
   cd CSE511---Project-
   ```
2. Load the dataset into PostgreSQL.
3. Run optimized queries from the `queries/` directory.
4. Analyze results in the `results/` folder.

## Results & Observations
- **Query execution time reduced by X%** after applying optimizations.
- **Indexing improved retrieval speed significantly** for large datasets.
- **Apache Spark outperformed traditional SQL** in distributed processing.
